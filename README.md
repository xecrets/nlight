# NLight
*** THIS IS A STRIPPED DOWN DEPENDENCY FREE FRORK of the NLight Toolbox. It essentially only contains the CSV
file parsing functionality, and the support required for it. ***

Toolbox for .NET projects

## Features

### NLight.Collections

* `BufferManager`: maintains a set of large arrays and gives clients segments of these that they can use as buffers
* `OrderedDictionary<TKey, TValue>`: dictionary that also keeps track of item order by implementing `IReadOnlyList<TValue>`
* `Trees.TreeTraversals`: functions to walk any tree in pre/in/post and level order (implemented without using recursion)

### NLight.Core

* `Buffer<T>`: a data buffer that can refill automatically via an user provided function
* `EnumHelper`
  * Validates enums 
  * Allows access to their metadata quickly
* `PreciseDateTime`: returns the current date as a high precision `DateTimeOffset`
* `StringExtensions`: extensions to remove diacritics and add more comparison options
* `StrongRandom`: provides the same functionalities as `System.Random` but uses `System.Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator`

### NLight.IO

* `IOHelper`
  * Copy and move operations with progress notification
  * Copy will create a symbolic link if possible
  * Provides a safe filesystem enumerator that ignores file access errors
* `Text.DelimitedTextRecordReader/Writer`: a fast and flexible delimited file reader and writer
* `Text.FixedWidthTextRecordReader/Writer`: a fast and flexible fixed width file reader and writer

### NLight.Reactive

* `BehaviorSubjectSlim<T>`: a `SubjectSlim<T>` (see below) that keeps track of the current value
* `SubjectSlim<T>`: an `ISubject<T>` implementation that is still thread-safe but avoids locking internally and stores observers with a `List<T>` with copy on write instead of an `ImmutableList<T>`
* `DeferredSubject<T>`: an `ISubject<T>` wrapper that buffers new elements in a `BlockingCollection<T>`
* `ObservableExtensions`
  * Ignore elements while converting the current one
  * Pairs the current element with the previous

### NLight.Text

* `StringValueConverter`: converts a string to any .NET primitive types, enums or Guid
* `Encoding.FastASCIIEncoding`: a plain ASCII encoding (ignores code pages) that uses loop unrolling to be faster
* `Parsing.EscapedStringParser`: parses backslash escaped strings

### NLight.Threading

* `Tasks.SingleThreadTaskScheduler`: a task scheduler that runs tasks on a single dedicated thread

### NLight.Transactions

* `TransactionManager`: a transaction manager that supports ambient nested transaction contexts
